A personal nutrition information tracker

----------------

The goal of this project is to create simple python script/program that will allow
people to track their daily nutrition intake as well as their exercise.

It meant to be simple in order to make modifying it and/or extending it as easy as possible.

The project is written in Python (currently verison 3.4), and it uses the Tk GUI as well SQLite.

Eventual goals for the project include the ability to sync personal data with the cloud
and an Android/iOS/Windows Phone/etc app.
